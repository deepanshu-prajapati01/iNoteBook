![sample Image](https://github.com/deepanshu-prajapati01/newsMonkeyWebApplication/blob/master/sampleScreenshot.png)

# Things i have learnt during this project: 

* This project was my first project which includes the functionality of backend and it gives great understanding.
* It also includes the user authentication system.

# Some important things: 

* Make sure to download [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for backend database, for better knowledge of setup refer to [this video...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWIeK3ueOm8&list=PLu0W_9lII9agx66oZnT6IyhcMIbUMNMdt&index=43&pp=iAQB)
* In this project the `backend` folder is inside the main `iNoteBook` folder.
* Both `backend` and `iNoteBook` have their separate dependencies which to be installed separately


# How to use this script:

* Step 1: Clone this repo using the following command.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/deepanshu-prajapati01/iNoteBook
```

* Step 2: Navigate to the cloned folder using the following command.

```shell
cd iNoteBook
```

* Step 3: Install all the required dependencies for the frontend and backend using the following command.

* Step 4: Before running the backend make sure to change your `mongoURI` from the backend file `db.js`. Later, use this shell to run backend:

```

* Step 5: Open one more `Shell` in the `iNoteBook` directory and run the following command (for the frontend): 

```shell
npm run start
```
